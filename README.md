# HoloXPLOR

On first run, HoloXPLOR will automatically download and extract files from the StarCitizen CDN, to the /App_Data directory of the project.

This project became obsolete as of Star Citizen patch 2.5, and has been replaced by the port-mod tool, and the ship customization screens.

Further tools to access Star Citizen data have been moved to https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k
